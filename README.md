# CRGSS
Crystal Game Scripting System created with CrSFML and inspired by RGSS.
Not intended to have compatibility, just inspired. Also not intended for use (yet). It's very incomplete, there are bugs, missing modules, missing features in the modules that do exist. There's also the fact that Crystal doesn't run on Windows (yet).

## Usage Instructions
WIP

## Requirements
